    <h2 id="whats-this-site-made-for">What’s this site made for?</h2>
    <p>Having a custom profile picture for your characters is great and stuff, but people used it against NCSoft rules, uploading porn pics. So, this option was blocked, and restrained to "in-game character shots" only. Any attempt to upload an external image is rejected.</p>
    <p>So, this little tool here allow you to use a custom image as if it was a legit in-game character shot. ☺</p>

    <div class="note note--important">Of course, don’t use my tool to upload porn pics on your character profile! You don’t want the character picture option to be fully blocked again, do you?<br> So be wise, and restrain your needs to put boobs and asses on your character. You will <strong>NOT</strong> look cooler or manlier because you show some babes. You’ll just look like a redneck moron unable to restrain himself.</div>

    <h2 id="how-to-proceed">How to proceed</h2>
    <p>Here’s what is going to happen. To use a custom image, we need to copy some meta informations on a real Character Shot, and transfer them on your custom image. That’s exactly what this tool will do.</p>

    <h3 id="get-character-shot">Get a Character Shot</h3>
    <p>The first point is to get a legit, working picture profile from the game.</p>
    <p>Log in with your character, open your Picture Gallery (<kbd>Escape</kbd> → <kbd>Picture Gallery</kbd>), and then click on the camera icon.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/01.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>A little window will open, with your character inside. Just take the picture by clicking on the camera icon.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/02.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>Your image has been saved in your <kbd>CharacterShots</kbd> folder. To find it, get back to Windows, open your <kbd>Images</kbd> folder, and you’ll find a dedicated Blade &amp; Soul folder callend <kbd>BnS</kbd>, in which you will find what you’re looking for.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/03.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>Now, get back to <kbd>bns-profile.surge.sh</kbd>, and click on the area below "Select a valid Blade &amp; Soul Character Shot", and select the legit image you just took. Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the picture inside the area.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/04.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>The picture will appear in the area. To change it, you can simply click on the trash icon.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/05.jpg" alt=""></p>

    <h3 id="create-a-custom-image">Create a custom image</h3>
    <p>Now, let’s create your future profile pic!</p>
    <p>You will need a software for manipulate and create images. The one I use and show here is Photoshop, but you can use Gimp, Photofiltre, and many others.</p>
    <div class="note note--info">I won’t provide any help for creating your custom image, or using one of the software I mentioned. If you don’t know how to use them, you can find many tutorials on the web, or ask on some graphic boards.</div>
    <p>First, you must be sure the image you’re creating is <strong>328px width</strong> and <strong>620px height</strong>.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/06.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>Now, you can use any image you wish, mine will be this lovely bunny.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/07.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>Next, you need to save your image somewhere on your computer, for example on the desktop (it is easy to find).</p>
    <div class="note note--important">Be sure to save your image using <strong>JPEG</strong> format (which file extension is <kbd>.jpg</kbd>)! If you don’t, your image won’t be converted.</div>
    <p>Now, back at <kbd>bns-profile.surge.sh</kbd>, and click on the area below "Select your custom image". Select the legit image you just made. Once again, you can simply drag and drop the picture inside the area.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/08.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>Your image will appear in the area, next to the first one. Finally, click on the send button to proceed.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/09.jpg" alt=""></p>

    <h3 id="use-your-custom-image-ingame">Use your custom image ingame</h3>
    <p>Once you’ve clicked on the button, a new page will show up, with your custom image inside. This is the one that have been proceed. Just right-click on it, and save it in you <kbd>CharacterShots</kbd> folder.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/10.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>Just give him the name you want.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/11.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <div class="note note--important">Be careful: fore some reasons, as it is a code-generated image, browsers behaviours could chage from one to another. Chrome will save it in a JPEG format, Firefox will add no format so you’ll have to add <kdb>.jpg</kdb> at the end of your filename, and Edge want to save it as a PNG, which is not good.<br> To avoid any problem while I can figure out how to properly set the image format, you should be very careful, or use Chrome if you have any doubt.</div>
    <p>Now, your image should be in your <kbd>CharacterShots</kbd> folder. Just get back in the game, and open your <kbd>Picture Gallery</kbd> again. You should see your newly crated image in there.</p>
    <p>Just hover it and click on the "register" button that show up.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/12.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>If everything goes well, you should hear the gamevoice telling you it’s done, and have a validation message system in the chat window.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/14.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>Just press <kbd>F2</kbd> to see your public profile. Your image should not be refresh yet, so you can click on the refresh button.</p>
    <p class="text-align-center"><img src="../assets/images/13.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>And you’re done!</p>
    <h4>Now you’ready, let’s <a v-link="{ name: 'home' }">go back to home</a></h4>

    <h2 id="improvements-and-ideas">Improvements and ideas</h2>
    <p>I will work on this tool in the future. For now, I have some points to work on :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure that the image is registered in jpg format</li>
      <li>Convert file format if the user give a wrong one</li>
      <li>Translate it in french (and maybe others languages if I get help)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can see my work on the <a href="https://github.com/EmmanuelBeziat/bns-profile/issues">github project</a>. If you have any idea or suggestion, or if you have found a bug, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/EmmanuelBeziat/bns-profile/issues/new">create a new ticket</a>, so we can discuss it.</p>

    <h2 id="who-are-you">You’re my hero, but who are you?</h2>
    <p>I’m a 29 years old french developer, living under the hot sun of south, with my feets in the Mediteranean sea.</p>
    <p>I’ve been playing Blade &amp; Sould for two years, and I definitely love to have a nice and custom character profile picture. That’s why I made this little tool, based on <a href="https://github.com/f4rnham/">f4rnham</a> work.</p>
    <p>If you encounter a BladeDancer Lyn named Kalturio, gimme a sign. ☺</p>
